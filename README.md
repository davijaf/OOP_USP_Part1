# About this Course

This course introduces the most important concepts around the most common development paradigm in the software industry today: Object Oriented Programming (OOP).

Offered by the Department of Computer Science of the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics at USP, the course is aimed at those who already know the basic concepts of OOP and want to delve into the subject, becoming an excellent programmer. It works well as a natural sequel to Prof. Fabio Kon from IME-USP on coursera: Introduction to Computer Science with Python. If you still don't know how to program, you should start with this other course: https://www.coursera.org/learn/ciencia-computacao-python-conceitos

But, if you already know how to program in another language comfortably, you can come straight to this course without much difficulty. Most of the code examples will be in Java and Python and we present a small overview of these languages ​​at the beginning of the course.

The course is divided into two parts of approximately 6 weeks each. In this Part 1, the topics covered are:

(1) Recap of basic OOP concepts
(2) UML (OO Unified Modeling Language)
(3) Interpreted languages ​​vs. compiled
(4) Object Orientation in Java and Python
(5) Code Quality and Good OO Programming Practices
(6) Bugs, debugging and testing
(7) Dynamic languages ​​vs. static
(8) Abstract classes and interfaces
(9) Object Collections
(10) Polymorphism
(11) Handling of Exceptions
(12) Streams (Data Flows)
(13) Design Patterns - Strategy, Adapter, Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Prototype, State
(14) Model-View-Controller (MVC)
